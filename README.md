# chess-detector
A program to use image recognition to scan various chessboards from various angles and recognize the location and color of pieces on the board. Feed can be drawn from a webcam to simulate a game and keep track of the locations of all the pieces.

## Examples
Here are some examples of running the algorithm on a few different chess boards.
